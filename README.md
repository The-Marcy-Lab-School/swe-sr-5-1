# Technical Writing Assignment

For guidance on setting up and submitting this assignment, refer to the Marcy lab School Docs How-To guide for [Working with Short Response and Coding Assignments](https://marcylabschool.gitbook.io/marcy-lab-school-docs/fullstack-curriculum/how-tos/working-with-assignments#how-to-work-on-assignments).

## Prompt 1

Imagine you are teaching a friend about OOP. They mainly want to understand what is Encapsulation. Write a brief lesson on Encapsulation that includes the following:

* What is encapsulation?
* What major goal does this help to achieve in software engineering?
* Give an example (in code) of encapsulation.
* An explanation of how the code example demonstrates encapsulation

### Response 1

## Prompt 2

The following `friendsManager` object is an example of an interface that is **NOT** consistent and predictable:

```js
const friendsManager = {
 friends: [],
 addFriend(newFriend) {
   if (typeof newFriend !== 'string') return;
   this.friends.push(newFriend);
 }
}


friendsManager.addFriend('daniel');
friendsManager.addFriend(true);
friendsManager.friends.push('emmaneul');
friendsManager.friends.push(42);
```

Explain how the code is not consistent or predictable, then provide an example in code that uses closure to make it more consistent and predictable.

### Response 2

## Prompt 3

With OOP in JavaScript, it's possible to use factory functions to achieve encapsulation and re-use them to make objects that look alike. However, factory functions have drawbacks and we often use classes instead. 

How would you explain to a budding developer what the drawbacks of using factory functions are and why it is better to use classes instead?

### Response 3

## Prompt 4

Do some research on the history of when / how classes were introduced into JavaScript and share your findings. Your response should include:

* What version of JavaScript were classes introduced in and when did it come out?
* Why were classes introduced into JavaScript?


### Response 4

## Prompt 5

OOP can still be achieved in JavaScript without using the `class` keyword and instead using the "Constructor Functions" and the "Prototype Chain" (look them up!)

```js
function Person(name, age) {
 this.name = name;
 this.age = age;
}


Person.prototype.greet = function () {
 return `Hi, I'm ${this.name}, and I'm ${this.age} years old.`;
};


const alice = new Person('Alice', 30);
console.log(alice.greet());
```

Provide one point that advocates for the use of this syntax and then provide a counter-argument for the use of classes instead.
